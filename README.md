# Decision-Tree-from-scratch-ID3
provides an in-depth tutorial on implementing a Decision Tree classifier from scratch using the ID3 algorithm with the Play Tennis dataset. It covers the mathematical foundations of entropy and information gain, manually calculating these metrics for each feature to determine the best split. 
This notebook, Decision_Trees_from_Scratch_.ipynb, guides users through the process of building a Decision Tree classifier from scratch using the ID3 algorithm on the Play Tennis dataset. It begins with a detailed mathematical explanation of entropy and information gain, applied to the dataset's features (Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Wind) to select the optimal root node split. The implementation includes Python functions for calculating entropy, information gain, and recursively constructing the tree, followed by visualization using anytree and prediction on the dataset with accuracy evaluation. To run the notebook, ensure Python 3, Jupyter, and required libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, anytree) are installed. Execute cells sequentially to explore the code and results, making it an excellent resource for learning decision tree algorithms and their practical application.
